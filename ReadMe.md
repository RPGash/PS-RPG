# Project "PS-RPG"

An RPG text adventure coded in PowerShell.

- Alpha build
- ~~May~~ Does contain bugs üêõ
- Currently only works on Windows ü™ü (not tested on macOS or Linux)

Why? - I love RPGs and PowerShell, so I thought it would be a good project.

Want to try it out? - If you do download and run it (a big if üòÖ haha), I suggest when you have first run the script, you maximise the window before continuing. You can then adjust the font size with CTRL + mouse wheel to make sure everything fits on the screen correctly.
