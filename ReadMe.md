# Project "PS-RPG"

An RPG text adventure coded in PowerShell.

- Alpha build
- ~~May~~ Does contain bugs üêõ
- Currently only works on Windows ü™ü (not tested on MAC or Linux)

Why? - I love RPGs and PowerShell so thought it would be a good project.

Want to try it out? - If you do download and run it (a big if haha), it is suggested to run the script then maximise the window before continuing. You can then adjust the font size with CTRL + mouse wheel to make sure everything fits on the screen correctly.
